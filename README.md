# Restaurant Search Application 🍽

This application, written in React-Native, displays a list of restaurants in a fixed area, in this case, San Jose, using the Yelp API. A maximum of 50 restaurants are categorized based on a price tag determined by the API. After pressing on an image, you'll be taken to a new page that displays more details about the restaurant.
