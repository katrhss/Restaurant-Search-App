# Restaurant Search Application 🍽

This application, written in React-Native, displays a list of restaurants in a fixed area, in this case, New York, using the Yelp API. A maximum of 50 restaurants are categorized based on a price tag determined by the API. After pressing on an image, you'll be taken to a new page that displays more details about the restaurant.

<summary>💡Inspiration and Details</summary>
Inspiration for this repository was a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course" target="_blank">Udemy Course</a> I was taking, focusing on React-Native fundamentals. While most of the content was made by following the course's instructions, I added some extra features myself after being done with it, so I could experiment with what I had learned.
